-   SASS
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

-   Learned **Sass**

### Useful resources

-   [resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR-a8upNjJ0&t=2s&ab_channel=KevinPowell) - This helped me for replace the deprecate import and how to use **@use** and **@forward**. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
-   [resource 2](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand **7-1 architecture**. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

-   [resource 3](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) - This helped me for learn markdown syntax
